This Python project uses the Gmail API to automate the cleanup of a Gmail inbox by deleting emails based on specific criteria, such as date or sender. It uses OAuth 2.0 for secure authentication and allows for periodic execution to keep the inbox clean. The script runs in a loop and exits automatically when no more emails match the deletion criteria, ensuring efficient and continuous inbox management.
